"""Track earth satellite TLE orbits using up-to-date 2010 version of SGP4

This Python package computes the position and velocity of an
earth-orbiting satellite, given the satellite's TLE orbital elements
from a source like `Celestrak <http://celestrak.com/>`_.  It implements
the most recent version of SGP4, and has been tested to make sure that
its satellite position predictions **agree to within 1 µm** of the
standard C++ implementation of the algorithm.





This implementation passes the automated tests in the August 2010
release of SGP4 by Vallado et al., who originally published their
revision of SGP4 in 2006:

    Vallado, David A., Paul Crawford, Richard Hujsak, and T.S. Kelso, “Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3,” presented at the AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Keystone, CO, 2006 August 21–24.

If you would like to review the paper, it is `available online
<http://www.celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/>`_.  You can
always download the latest version of their code for comparison against
this Python module (or other implementations) at `AIAA-2006-6753.zip
<http://www.celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/AIAA-2006-6753.zip>`_.

This module was adapted from Vallado's C++ code since its revision date
was the most recently updated SPG4 implementation in their zip file:

* C++, August 2010
* Fortran, August 2008
* Pascal, August 2008
* Matlab, May 2008
* Java, July 2005
